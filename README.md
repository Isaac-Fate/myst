# MyST -- My SecreTs

A simple CLI password/secret manager.

- You are prompted to set up the passphrase and the location of the data store the first time you use the program.
- Even when all your secrets are exposed, you are safe since they are encrypted. The only way to recover them is via your passphrase.
